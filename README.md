# RAG-based-Document-Search-System
This project is an intelligent Q&amp;A chatbot that allows you to "chat" with your own documents. It uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with LangChain and OpenAI to provide accurate, source-cited answers from any PDF or text file, effectively turning your personal files into a searchable knowledge base.
